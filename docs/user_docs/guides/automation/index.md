# Automation

KCL provides many automation related capabilities, mainly including tools and multilingual APIs. Via `package_identifier : key_identifier` mode, KCL supports the indexing of any configured key value, thus completing the addition, deletion, modification and query of any key value. For example, the following figure shows that we can directly execute the following command to modify the image. The code diff before and after modification is also shown in the figure.

In addition, the automation capability of KCL can be realized and integrated into CI/CD.
