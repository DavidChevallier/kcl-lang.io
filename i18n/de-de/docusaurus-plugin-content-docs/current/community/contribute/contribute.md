# Contribute Guide

If it is the first time to participate in the open-source community, you can first check the similar changes in Issue und PR (PullRequest). Then you can fully discuss your own problems with the community or development team classmates, und you can also feedback the problems encountered by creating issues, und then you can provide code patches f√ºr related issues. At the beginning, you can start with document improvement und partial code improvement, such as: documentation, Examples, multi-language Binding, etc. At the same time, students who want to participate deeply can contribute to core features such as language functions, language testing, programming frameworks, und various backends.
