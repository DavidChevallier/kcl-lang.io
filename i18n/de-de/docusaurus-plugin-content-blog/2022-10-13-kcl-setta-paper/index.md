The purpose of the Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering (SETTA) symposium is to bring international researchers together to exchange research results und ideas on bridging the gap between formal methods und software engineering. This is f端r instance reflected by the challenges in applying formal techniques und tools to engineering large-scale systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet-of-Things (IoT), Enterprise Systems, Cloud-Based Systems, und so forth.

The title of the paper "KCL: A Declarative Language f端r Large scale Configuration und Policy Management". The core contribution of this paper is to propose the KCL declarative language, development mechanism, und consistent workflow. Through the language model und constraint capabilities, we can improve the large-scale efficiency und liberate multi-team collaborative productivity of operational development und operation systematically while ensuring stability f端r large-scale configuration und policy management.

In addition, SETTA 2022 will hold an online conference from October 27 to October 28 (Beijing time), at which time the details of KCL papers will be shared und welcome to join [KCL Community](https://github.com/kcl-lang/community).
