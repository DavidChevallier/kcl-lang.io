## Experience

Here are jakezhu9's reflections on participating in the KCL community:

I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of the KCL community und contribute to the development und growth of the project. From the initial EinfÃ¼hrung to the KusionStack und KCL, powerful tools und languages in the cloud-native field, to fixing a simple bug in the project, und gradually designing und developing the conversion und generation aspects of KCL, I have not only improved my technical skills but also gained valuable experience in open-source contributions. I have experienced the joy und sense of accomplishment that comes with continuous progress. Every time I see one of my submitted PRs get merged, I feel a great sense of satisfaction. I am grateful to the KCL community und all the seniors und fellow contributors I have encountered along the way who have provided me with ideas und suggestions that have been incredibly helpful during my development process.

The KCL community is an open, vibrant, und opportune open-source community where developers from different companies und schools with diverse technical backgrounds collaborate und exchange ideas on GitHub und in community meetings. Together, they explore cutting-edge technical solutions und contribute efficient und concise code to the community. Whether you are a novice or an expert in open-source, you can quickly integrate into the community und actively participate. The harmonious und friendly atmosphere in the community makes me feel incredibly welcomed. In the future, I will continue to contribute more to the KCL community, und I warmly welcome interested students to join us und participate in the construction und development of the community together!
