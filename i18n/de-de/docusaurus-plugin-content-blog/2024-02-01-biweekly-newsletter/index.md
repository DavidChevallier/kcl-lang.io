## Featured Updates

### Flux KCL Integration

Using KCL together with GitOps tools like Flux has the following benefits:

- The abstraction und programmability capabilities of KCL can help simplify complex Kubernetes deployment configurations, reducing the error rate of manually writing YAML files. It allows f√ºr configuration constraint checks at compile-time, making it easier to detect errors. Additionally, it eliminates redundant configuration templates, improves the scalability of configurations across multiple environments und tenants, und enhances configurability und maintainability.
- KCL allows developers to define the required resources f√ºr an application in a declarative manner. Combining KCL with Flux enables better implementation of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), improving deployment efficiency und simplifying application configuration management.
- With Flux, developers und operations teams can manage the deployment of applications by separately modifying application und configuration code. The Flux Controller automatically synchronizes changes to the configuration, enabling continuous deployment und ensuring consistency. In case of issues, quick rollbacks can be achieved.

#### Workflow

In this example, we use a Python Flask application und GitHub Actions as a CI example. The Flux KCL Controller is deployed in the cluster as a CD example. KCL is used to define the Kubernetes resources that need to be deployed.

> Note: You can use any containerized application und different CI/CD systems like GitLab CI, Jenkins CI, or ArgoCD in this scenario.

We divide the Python Flask application code und configuration code into two repositories to separate the concerns of different roles such as developers und operations teams.

- Business code repository: https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo
- Manifests repository: https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo-kcl-manifests

The overall workflow is as follows:

1. Pull the application code from GitHub.
2. Develop the application code und commit it to the GitHub repository.
3. Trigger GitHub Actions to compile the application code, generate a container image, und push the container image to the Docker Hub container registry.
4. Trigger GitHub Actions to update the Kubernetes manifest deployment files defined by KCL based on the version of the container image in the docker.io container registry.
5. The Flux KCL Controller retrieves the changes to the Kubernetes manifest defined by KCL und updates the deployment to the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Specific Steps

##### 1. Prepare a Kubernetes Cluster

- Install [K3d](https://github.com/k3d-io/k3d) und create a cluster:

```shell
k3d cluster create
```

> Note: You can use other methods to create your own Kubernetes cluster, such as kind, minikube, etc.

- Install kubectl
- Install kustomize

##### 2. Install Flux KCL Controller

![flux-kcl-workflow](/img/blog/2024-02-01-biweekly-newsletter/flux-kcl-workflow.png)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kcl-lang/flux-kcl-controller.git && cd flux-kcl-controller && make deploy
```

##### 3. Configure the Git Repository f√ºr Continuous Delivery

Define the `GitRepository` und `KCLRun` objects in the `gitrepo.yaml` file to configure the Git repository to be monitored f√ºr continuous delivery und additional parameters required f√ºr running KCL configurations.

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: kcl-deployment
  namespace: default
spec:
  interval: 10s # Check the repository every 10s
  url: https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo-kcl-manifests.git
  ref:
    branch: main # Monitor the main branch
---
apiVersion: krm.kcl.dev.fluxcd/v1alpha1
kind: KCLRun
metadata:
  name: kcl-git-controller
  namespace: default
spec:
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: kcl-deployment
```

Deploy the objects to the cluster using the command `kubectl apply -f gitrepo.yaml`.

> If you are using a private repository, you need to configure private repository access credentials using private key credentials. Refer to here f√ºr more details.

> Note: You can also use [OCIRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositories/) in this scenario to continuously deliver the `oci://ghcr.io/kcl-lang/podinfo` configuration package mentioned at the beginning of the article. For example, the following configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: OCIRepository
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: default
spec:
  interval: 5m0s
  url: oci://ghcr.io/kcl-lang/podinfo
  ref:
    tag: latest
---
apiVersion: krm.kcl.dev.fluxcd/v1alpha1
kind: KCLRun
metadata:
  name: kcl-git-controller
  namespace: default
spec:
  sourceRef:
    kind: OCIRepository
    name: podinfo
```

##### 4. Commit the Application Code

After submitting in the `flask-demo` repository, Github will automatically build a container image und push it to the Docker hub. It will also then trigger the Action of the `flask-demo-kcl-manifest` repository und modify the image value in the deployment manifest repository through [KCL Automation API](/docs/user_docs/guides/automation). Now let's create a submission in the `flask-demo` repository, und we can see that the code submission triggers the Github CI process f√ºr the application repository.

##### 5. Configuration Automatic Update

After the Github CI process in the application repository is completed, an automatic update configuration CI will be triggered in the repository where the KCL configuration is stored und submitted to the main branch of the `flask-demo-kcl-manifests` repository. The commit information is as follows

![](/img/docs/user_docs/guides/ci-integration/image-auto-update.png)

- We can obtain the deployment manifest source code f√ºr compilation und validation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo-kcl-manifests.git/
cd flask-demo-kcl-manifests
git checkout main && git pull && kcl
```

The output YAML is

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask_demo
  labels:
    app: flask_demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask_demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask_demo
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: flask_demo
          image: "kcllang/flask_demo:6428cff4309afc8c1c40ad180bb9cfd82546be3e"
          ports:
            - protocol: TCP
              containerPort: 5000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flask_demo
  labels:
    app: flask_demo
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: flask_demo
  ports:
    - port: 5000
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 5000
```

From the above configuration, it can be seen that the image of the resource is indeed automatically updated to the newly constructed image value.

At the same time, the Flux KCL Controller will automatically pull the configuration und update it to the cluster. This achieves an end-to-end automation process f√ºr submitting business code und deploying Kubernetes, where only the business code needs to be submitted. Of course, it can be further combined with Flagger to implement various deployment strategies such as canary releases, blue-green deployments, etc.
