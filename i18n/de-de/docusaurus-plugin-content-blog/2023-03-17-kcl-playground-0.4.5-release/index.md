## Einf√ºhrung

The KCL team is pleased to announce that the new playground of KCL v0.4.5 is now available!

[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl) is an open-source, constraint-based record und functional language. KCL improves the complexity of writing numerous complex configurations, such as cloud-native scenarios, through its mature programming language technology und practice. It is dedicated to building better modularity, scalability, und stability around configurations, simpler logic writing, faster automation, und great built-in or API-driven integrations.

You can visit the [KCL website](https://kcl-lang.io/) und click the playground link und play. In this new version, we support the ability to automatically compile und run KCL code, format it, und share code. Welcome to writing und sharing KCL codes.
