## Experience

Here are jakezhu9's reflections on participating in the KCL community:

I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of the KCL community and contribute to the development and growth of the project. From the initial introduction to the KusionStack and KCL, powerful tools and languages in the cloud-native field, to fixing a simple bug in the project, and gradually designing and developing the conversion and generation aspects of KCL, I have not only improved my technical skills but also gained valuable experience in open-source contributions. I have experienced the joy and sense of accomplishment that comes with continuous progress. Every time I see one of my submitted PRs get merged, I feel a great sense of satisfaction. I am grateful to the KCL community and all the seniors and fellow contributors I have encountered along the way who have provided me with ideas and suggestions that have been incredibly helpful during my development process.

The KCL community is an open, vibrant, and opportune open-source community where developers from different companies and schools with diverse technical backgrounds collaborate and exchange ideas on GitHub and in community meetings. Together, they explore cutting-edge technical solutions and contribute efficient and concise code to the community. Whether you are a novice or an expert in open-source, you can quickly integrate into the community and actively participate. The harmonious and friendly atmosphere in the community makes me feel incredibly welcomed. In the future, I will continue to contribute more to the KCL community, and I warmly welcome interested students to join us and participate in the construction and development of the community together!
