[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is a constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that enhances the writing of complex configurations, including those for cloud-native scenarios. With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.

This section will update the KCL language community's latest developments every two weeks, including features, website updates, and the latest community news, helping everyone better understand the KCL community!

## Featured Updates

### Using Kubernetes Strategy Merge Patch to Update Configurations in KCL

In the current version of KCL, various **attribute operators** are supported to update and override configurations. However, the capability is relatively atomic and cannot cover the typical configuration strategy scenarios in cloud-native environments.

For Kubernetes configurations, it is common to use the `JSON Merge Patch` and `Strategy Merge Patch` capabilities natively supported by Kubernetes e.g., using tools such as `kubectl patch`, `kustomize`, and other patching capabilities supported by cloud-native configuration and policy tools.

To avoid repeatedly using KCL attribute operators to write configuration patch template codes when dealing with Kubernetes configurations, we provide the **Kubernetes Strategy Merge Patch library** for updating Kubernetes configurations. This library supports all merging strategies defined by native Kubernetes objects, such as overwriting, modifying, and adding items to list objects. Here is how to use it:

Create a new project and add the Strategy Merge Patch library dependency:

```shell
kcl mod init && kcl mod add strategic_merge_patch
```

Write the configuration patch code in `main.k` (using the `labels`, `replicas`, and `container` attributes of a `Deployment` template as an example):

```python
import strategic_merge_patch as s

original = {
    "apiVersion": "apps/v1",
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "my-deployment",
        "labels": {
            "app": "my-app"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 3,
        "template": {
            "spec": {
                "containers": [
                    {
                        "name": "my-container-1",
                        "image": "my-image-1"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "my-container-2",
                        "image": "my-image-2"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

patch = {
    "apiVersion": "apps/v1",
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "my-deployment",
        "labels": {
            "version": "v1"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "replicas": 4,
        "template": {
            "spec": {
                "containers": [
                    {
                        "name": "my-container-1",
                        "image": "my-new-image-1"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "my-container-3",
                        "image": "my-image-3"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

got = s.merge(original, patch)
```

Run the command to get the output:

```shell
kcl run
```

The output will be:

```yaml
original:
  metadata:
    name: my-deployment
    labels:
      app: my-app
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: my-container-1
          image: my-image-1
        - name: my-container-2
          image: my-image-2
patch:
  metadata:
    labels:
      version: v1
  spec:
    replicas: 4
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: my-container-1
          image: my-new-image-1
        - name: my-container-3
          image: my-image-3
got:
  metadata:
    name: my-deployment
    labels:
      app: my-app
      version: v1
  spec:
    replicas: 4
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: my-container-1
          image: my-new-image-1
        - name: my-container-2
          image: my-image-2
        - name: my-container-3
          image: my-image-3
```

As seen in the output, the labels, replicas, and container fields of the Deployment template have all been updated with the correct values. For more documentation and usage examples, please refer to [the document](https://artifacthub.io/packages/kcl/kcl-module/strategic_merge_patch).
