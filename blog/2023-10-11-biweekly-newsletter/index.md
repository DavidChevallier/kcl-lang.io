[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language that enhances the writing of complex configurations, including those for cloud-native scenarios. With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.

This section will update the KCL language community's latest developments every two weeks, including features, website updates, and the latest community news, helping everyone better understand the KCL community!

## Featured Updates

### IDE Extension Updates

In the recent v0.6.0 release, the KCL IDE plugin has enhanced on hover tooltips for the standard library and builtin functions, along with support for quick fixes for KCL code errors. Additionally, end-to-end tests for the language server and integration tests for the konfig repository have been added to ensure the stability and iteration of the IDE plugin. In the upcoming release, a new `kcl-language-server version` subcommand has been added to display version information. Please refer to [https://kcl-lang.io/docs/user_docs/getting-started/install/#2-install-kcl-ide-extension](https://kcl-lang.io/docs/user_docs/getting-started/install/#2-install-kcl-ide-extension) for instructions on how to upgrade and install the KCL IDE extension in various IDE platforms.

#### IntelliJ Plugin

Besides, the IntelliJ plugin is now compatible with version 2023.2+ and can be downloaded from the following link: [https://github.com/kcl-lang/intellij-kcl/releases](https://github.com/kcl-lang/intellij-kcl/releases)


### KCL Package Manager Updates

The kpm run command now supports compiling KCL files and has integrated an import tool. Additionally, the `--quiet` option has been added to suppress output logs.

### KCL Models Updates

In the past few weeks, we have provided more usage examples for configuring and validating containers, services, and Pod Security Policy (PSP). 

+ readonly-root-fs
+ allowed-image-repos
+ deny-all
+ deny-endpoint-edit-default-role
+ disallow-ingress-wildcard
+ disallow-svc-lb
+ disallow-svc-node-port
+ disallowed-image-repos
+ horizontal-pod-auto-scaler
+ psp-allow-privilege-escalation
+ psp-app-armor
+ psp-capabilities
+ psp-flexvolume-drivers
+ required-image-digests
+ required-probes
+ validate-auto-mount-service-account-token
+ validate-container-limits
+ validate-container-requests
+ validate-deprecated-api
+ k8s_manifests_containers

You can refer to the corresponding examples to incorporate the above configurations and validations: [https://github.com/kcl-lang/krm-kcl/tree/main/examples](https://github.com/kcl-lang/krm-kcl/tree/main/examples). Now, let's explain using the Kubectl KCL plugin and the disallow-svc-lb model. The purpose of disallow-svc-lb is to validate Service resources and disallow the use of LoadBalancer as the Service type. Write the following YAML file (manifests.yaml): 

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: krm.kcl.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: KCLRun
  metadata:
    name: disallow-svc-lb
    annotations: 
      krm.kcl.dev/version: 0.0.1
      krm.kcl.dev/type: validation
      documentation: >-
        A validation that prevents the creation of Service resources of type `LoadBalancer`
  spec:
    source: oci://ghcr.io/kcl-lang/disallow-svc-lb
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: my-service
  spec:
    selector:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
    ports:
      - name: http
        protocol: TCP
        port: 80
    type: LoadBalancer # The service type is incorrectly set to LoadBalancer.
  ```
Using the Kubectl KCL tool for resource validation on the client-side, we will get the following result:

  ```shell
  $ kubectl kcl check -f manifests.yaml
  - A validation that prevents the creation of Service resources of type `LoadBalancer`, for Service: my-service
  ```
