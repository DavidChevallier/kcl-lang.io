## Introduction

The KCL team is pleased to announce that KCL v0.8.0 is now available! This release has brought three key updates to everyone: **Language**, **Tools**, and **Integrations**.

- _Use KCL language, tools and IDE extensions with more complete features and fewer errors to improve code writing experience and efficiency._

- _More comprehensive and rich community ecosystem integration, improving operation and maintenance experience._

- _More comprehensive KCL third-party dependencies, easier integration with cloud-native ecosystem._

KCL v0.8.0 is now available for download at [KCL v0.8.0 Release Page](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/releases/tag/v0.8.0) or [KCL Official Website](https://kcl-lang.io).

[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl) is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). KCL improves the writing of numerous complex configurations, such as cloud-native scenarios, through its mature programming language technology and practice. It is dedicated to building better modularity, scalability, and stability around configurations, simpler logic writing, faster automation, and great built-in or API-driven integrations.

This blog will introduce the content of KCL v0.8.0 and recent developments in the KCL community to readers.

## Language Updates

### üöó Grammar and Semantics Updates

#### KCL supports `show-hidden`

KCL v0.8.0 adds support for `--show-hidden` to display private variables.

The `main.k`

```kcl
a = {_b = 1}
```

Compile by `kcl run main.k --show-hidden`.

```yaml
a:
  _b: 1
```

#### KCL supports arguments and keyword arguments union

KCL v0.8.0 adds support for arguments and keyword arguments union. Schema instances with arguments will union arguments during union operations.

```kcl
schema Person[separator]:
    firstName: str = "John"
    lastName: str
    fullName: str = firstName + separator + lastName

x = Person(" ") {lastName = "Doe"}

y = Person("-") {lastName = "Doe1"}

z = x | y
```

The compiled result is as follows:

```yaml
x:
  firstName: John
  lastName: Doe
  fullName: John Doe
y:
  firstName: John
  lastName: Doe1
  fullName: John-Doe1
z:
  firstName: John
  lastName: Doe1
  fullName: John-Doe1
```

#### KCL supports scalar yaml stream output

In v0.8.0, by using `yaml_stream` method, you can output the result of yaml scalar.

```kcl
import manifests

x0 = 1
x1 = 2
manifests.yaml_stream([x0, x1])
```

The compiled result is as follows:

```yaml
1
---
2
```

#### KCL removes the `__settings__` attribute in the compiled output

In v0.8.0, the `__settings__` attribute is removed from the compiled output.

```kcl
schema Person:
    __settings__: {str:str} = {"output_type": "STANDALONE"}
    name?: str
    age?: int
    school?: str

a = Person{
    name: "a",
}
```

The compiled result is as follows.

```yaml
a:
  name: a
```

#### KCL supports the key and value evaluation in the config expression

In v0.8.0, KCL supports the key and value evaluation in the config expression.

```kcl
_data = {
    "a": 'foo'
    "b": 'bar'
}

r0 = [{v = k} for k, v in _data]
r1 = [{k = v} for k, v in _data]
r2 = [{k.foo = v} for k, v in _data]
r3 = [[k] for k, v in _data]
r4 = [[k, v] for k, v in _data]
```

The compiled result is as follows.

```yaml
r0:
- foo: a
- bar: b
r1:
- a: foo
- b: bar
r2:
- a:
    foo: foo
- b:
    foo: bar
r3:
- - a
- - b
r4:
- - a
  - foo
- - b
  - bar
```

### üöÄ Diagnostic Optimization

KCL uses the `elif` keyword in the `if` block, not `else if`.

Compile the following KCL program:

```kcl
if True: a = 1
else if False: b = 1
```

The diagnostic information in KCL has added suggestions for error correction:

```shell
error[E1001]: InvalidSyntax
 --> main.k:2:6
  |
2 | else if False: b = 1
  |      ^ 'else if' here is invalid in KCL, consider using the 'elif' keyword
  |
```

### üöÄ Language writing experience optimization

#### KCL standard library adds file system access functions

KCL has added methods to access the file system. In v0.8.0, it supports methods such as `read`, `glob`, etc. to access the file system.

By using the `read`, you can read the contents of a file as a string.

```kcl
import file

a = file.read("hello.txt")
```

Add the following content to the `hello.txt` file:

```shell
Hello World !
```

The compilation result is as follows:

```shell
a: Hello World !
```

By combining the `json.decode` method, you can easily deserialize a JSON file.

Add the following content to the `hello.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 10
}
```

KCL program:

```kcl
import file
import json

_a = json.decode(file.read("hello.json"))

name = _a.name
age = _a.age
```

The compilation result is as follows:

```yaml
name: John
age: 10
```

More details - <https://kcl-lang.io/zh-CN/docs/reference/model/file/>

#### KCL Compiler supports the use of environment variable `KCL_CACHE_PATH` to specify the cache path

KCL Compiler will cache the generated code to the directory specified by the environment variable `KCL_CACHE_PATH`. If not specified, it will be generated to the project root directory.

#### KCL Plugin System supports using Golang to write KCL plugins

KCL Plugin System supports using Golang to write KCL plugins. The following is an example of using Golang to define the `hello` plugin.

```golang
package hello_plugin

import (
    "kcl-lang.io/kcl-go/pkg/plugin"
)

func init() {
    plugin.RegisterPlugin(plugin.Plugin{
        Name: "hello",
        MethodMap: map[string]plugin.MethodSpec{
            "add": {
                Body: func(args *plugin.MethodArgs) (*plugin.MethodResult, error) {
                    v := args.IntArg(0) + args.IntArg(1)
                    return &plugin.MethodResult{V: v}, nil
                },
            },
        },
    })
}
```

With the `hello` plugin, you can use the `add` method in the KCL program.

```kcl
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "kcl-lang.io/kcl-go/pkg/kcl"
    "kcl-lang.io/kcl-go/pkg/native"                // Import the native API
    _ "kcl-lang.io/kcl-go/pkg/plugin/hello_plugin" // Import the hello plugin
)

func main() {
    // Note we use `native.MustRun` here instead of `kcl.MustRun`, because it needs the cgo feature.
    yaml := native.MustRun("main.k", kcl.WithCode(code)).GetRawYamlResult()
    fmt.Println(yaml)
}

const code = `
import kcl_plugin.hello

name = "kcl"
three = hello.add(1,2) # 3
```

### üò∏ KCL supports linux arm64

KCL v0.8.0 adds support for the Linux arm64 platform in the release product.

You can find the compressed package with the suffix `linux-arm64` on the [KCL Release Page](https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/releases)

### üèÑ SDK & API Updates

#### Rust SDK

KCL Rust SDK provides a series of APIs for compiling, validating, testing, and formatting KCL files.

[KCL Rust SDK: https://github.com/kcl-lang/lib](https://github.com/kcl-lang/lib)

## IDE & Toolchain Updates

### IDE Updates

#### IDE semantic-level highlighting enhancement

KCL IDE previously only supported KCL syntax highlighting, as shown in the figure below:

![old-ide](/img/blog/2024-01-18-biweekly-newsletter/old-ide.png)

We have gradually introduced a new KCL semantic model in the past year. With the support of the new semantic model, KCL IDE now supports semantic-level highlighting. Code that is semantically related will be highlighted in the same way.

![new-ide](/img/blog/2024-01-18-biweekly-newsletter/new-ide.png)

For more information about the KCL semantic model, see:
[Unlocking Advanced Code Intelligence with the KCL Semantic Model](https://kcl-lang.io/zh-CN/blog/2023-12-09-kcl-new-semantic-model)

#### IDE supports completion of builtin methods

KCL IDE supports completion of builtin methods, as shown in the figure below:

- Corrected an exception-triggering issue in function autocompletion within strings.
- Resolved an autocompletion error when a comment followed a string.
- Fixed an issue where internal property symbols in schemas couldn‚Äôt navigate.
- Addressed an exception in alias semantic checks and autocompletion for import statements.
- Rectified autocompletion issues in check expressions within schemas.
- Fixed autocompletion errors in nested schema definitions.
- Resolved missing hover information for certain elements.
- Ensured consistent symbol types for autocompletion across different syntaxes.
- Distinguished between schema type and instance autocompletion symbols.
- Standardized schema comment documentation autocompletion format.
- Fixed issues where symbols within configuration block if statements couldn‚Äôt navigate or autocompletion was affected.

### Vet Tool Updates

In v0.8.0 release, we have optimized the diagnostic of the KCL verification tool. In the work of using the KCL verification tool to verify json/yaml files, the abnormal location of the json file will be accurately located.

Take `hello.json` as an example, we will verify the content of the json file through the following `main.k` file.

```json
{
    "name": 10,
    "age": 18,
    "message": "This is Alice"
}
```

The `main.k`

```kcl
schema User:
    name: str
    age: int
    message?: str
```

We can verify the content of the json file through the following command.

```shell
kcl vet hello.json main.k
```

We can see the error location in the json file:

```shell
error[E2G22]: TypeError
 --> test.json:2:5
  |
2 |     "name": 10,
  |     ^ expected str, got int(10)
  |

 --> main.k:2:5
  |
2 |     name: str
  |     ^ variable is defined here, its type is str, but got int(10)
  |
```

#### KCL cli supports git repository as a compilation entry

By using the following command, you can use the KCL git repository as a compilation entry.

```shell
kcl run <git url>
```

#### kcl mod graph supports output KCL package dependency graph

You can use command `kcl mod graph` to output the KCL package dependency graph.

### KCL Package Management

#### KCL Package Management supports adding git dependencies through commit

KCL Package Management adds the ability to add git repo dependencies through commit. For example, using <https://github.com/KusionStack/catalog>Ôºåadd commit `a29e3db` as a dependency. You can add it through editing the kcl.mod file or directly through the command line.

Edit the kcl.mod file as follows:

```toml
[dependencies]
catalog = { git = "https://github.com/KusionStack/catalog.git", commit = "a29e3db" }
```

Or add it through the command line:

```shell
kcl mod add -git https://github.com/KusionStack/catalog.git -commit a29e3db
```

#### KCL Package Management supports the dependency name with `-`

KCL Package Management supports the dependency name with `-`. For example, you can add the `set-annotation` as a dependency through the following command:

```shell
kcl mod add set-annotation
```

In the KCL program, you can reference it through `set_annotation`.

```kcl
import set_annotation 
```

### KCL Import Tool

- Support mapping OpenAPI multiplyOf specification to KCL multiplyof function for validation.
- Support outputting multiple KCL files from YAML Stream-formatted Kubernetes CRD files.
- Support generating validation expressions for OpenAPI allOf keyword.
- Support generating validation expressions for KCL array and dictionary types using all/any.
