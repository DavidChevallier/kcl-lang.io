[KCL](https://github.com/kcl-lang) is a constraint-based record and functional language hosted by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that enhances the writing of complex configurations, including those for cloud-native scenarios. With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.

This section will update the KCL language community's latest developments every two weeks, including features, website updates, and the latest community news, helping everyone better understand the KCL community!

## Featured Updates

### KCL IDE Semantic Highlighting Enhancement

KCL IDE previously only supported KCL syntax highlighting, as shown in the figure below:

This year, we gradually enabled the new KCL semantic architecture model. With the support of the new semantic architecture, KCL IDE supports semantic-level highlighting, and the code related to semantics will be highlighted in the same way.

### KCL Package Management Tool Supports Adding Git Dependencies via Commit

KCL Package Management Tool supports adding git dependencies via commit. 
Take https://github.com/KusionStack/catalog as an example, add commit a29e3db as a dependency. You can add it directly through the dependency in the kcl.mod file or the command line.

Edit the kcl.mod file as follows:
```
[dependencies]
catalog = { git = "https://github.com/KusionStack/catalog.git", commit = "a29e3db" }
```

Or add it via the command line:

```
kcl mod add -git https://github.com/KusionStack/catalog.git -commit a29e3db
```

### KCL Import Tool Enhancement

The import tool supports the generation with oneOf and allOf keywords. Take the oneOf keyword as an example, save the following content in the file oneof.json.

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/book.json",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "author": {
      "$comment": "oneOf for types",
      "oneOf": [
        {
          "type": "string"
        },
        {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "integer"
        }
      ]
    },
    "category": {
      "$comment": "oneOf for objects",
      "oneOf": [
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "name": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "title": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Through the import command, you can generate the corresponding KCL file.

```
kcl import oneof.json
```

You can see that the generated oneof.k file content is as follows.

```kcl
"""
This file was generated by the KCL auto-gen tool. DO NOT EDIT.
Editing this file might prove futile when you re-run the KCL auto-gen generate command.
"""

schema Book:
    r"""
    Book

    Attributes
    ----------
    title : str, optional
    author : str | [str] | int, optional
    category : BookCategoryOneOf0 | BookCategoryOneOf1, optional
    """

    title?: str
    author?: str | [str] | int
    category?: BookCategoryOneOf0 | BookCategoryOneOf1

schema BookCategoryOneOf0:
    r"""
    BookCategoryOneOf0

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str, optional
    """

    name?: str

schema BookCategoryOneOf1:
    r"""
    BookCategoryOneOf1

    Attributes
    ----------
    title : str, optional
    """

    title?: str
```
